### Whole Brain 

These past few months I started working on an art journal/diary, its pretty messy but I absolutely love it. I'm not used to  
putting my thoughts into words on a daily basis so that experience was a lot of fun and is something i want to continue doing.  
I ended up with some chaotic and ridiculous entries. It also helped me expand and develop my story ideas to the point that 
Ifeel confident in making a future dark comedy graphic novel.  

  

### Golden Circle 

why: To bring more awareness to mental health issues and what people go through internally.  

How: By having people share their stories to show others that they are not alone.  

What: Use different platforms/media outlets to make it possible so that it reaches people in need. 

  

### Elevator pitch 

Hello! My name is Sergio and I would like to use all sorts artistic mediums to spred mental health awareness 
and have a place where people can express what they are going through and maybe seek the help they need.

### Week 1 Reflection 

First week was fun, I got to know the people in my class pretty well. We got split into groups to work on a project 
where we designed a board game. It was interesting seeing other peoples thought process into what makes a good game, I  
learned a lot working with them. We had a few side projects that showed me how cool it can 
be to integrate tech into things. I cant wait to see what else ill end up learning. 

### Week 2 Reflection  

The second week I started to understand things a bit more as far as how the class goes. We got our Vyond accounts set up and so that was pretty dope I made a few animated commercials that turned out silly.  Playing with Vyond and looking up how to use different features of the program was really helpful in trying to understand how to properly use it.  I set up my unity account as well but havent really played around with that program just yet but that’s my next project.  

### Week 3 Reflection 

Week three I worked on a digital drawing for the CNM nature walk of the Sandia mountains, hopefully they like it because if they do they’ll end up displaying it. Other than that I worked with my team preparing our first podcast episode and played around with unity some more.  Britney also took us to the makers space close by and that was dope, they have so many tools I want to use so maybe ill sign up.
