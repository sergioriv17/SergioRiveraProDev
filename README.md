### Whole Brain 

These past few months I started working on an art journal/diary, its pretty messy but I absolutely love it. I'm not used to  
putting my thoughts into words on a daily basis so that experience was a lot of fun and is something i want to continue doing.  
I ended up with some chaotic and ridiculous entries. It also helped me expand and develop my story ideas to the point that 
Ifeel confident in making a future dark comedy graphic novel.  

  

### Golden Circle 

why: To bring more awareness to mental health issues and what people go through internally.  

How: By having people share their stories to show others that they are not alone.  

What: Use different platforms/media outlets to make it possible so that it reaches people in need. 

  

### Elevator pitch 

Hello! My name is Sergio and I would like to use all sorts artistic mediums to spred mental health awareness 
and have a place where people can express what they are going through and maybe seek the help they need. 

  

### Week 1 Reflection 

First week was fun, I got to know the people in my class pretty well. We got split into groups to work on a project 
where we designed a board game. It was interesting seeing other peoples thought process into what makes a good game, I  
learned a lot working with them. We had a few side projects that showed me how cool it can 
be to integrate tech into things. I cant wait to see what else ill end up learning.
